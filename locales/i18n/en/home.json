      "one": "Some forty countries have incorporated this technology into their food codes to process more than 200 various foods or preparations. In Argentina, there are 25 years of experience operating the radiant unit",
      "two": "lonization treatment does not produce effluents. A decrease in the microbiological content of food reduces logistics costs and costs due to rejection and waste. Betier conservation without the need for cold, increases the competitiveness of food products in the world market. This method, with more than 40 years of studies and tests, is supported by reports of the joint FAO/WHO/IAEA Expert Commitiee (International Food and Agriculture, Health and Atomic Energy of the United Nations), from the years 1981, 1991, 1999, according to the fact that they do not produce nutritional changes significant, neither teratogenic nor mutagenic, and not carcinogenic, due to the effect of ionization.",

            "two": "From a socio-environmental point of view, having animal protein that does not require a cold chain while maintaining its properties for at least 6 months at room temperature becomes a product capable of providing quality food to dispersed communities, far from centers of distribution and consumption, or difficult to access by terrestrial means, or that do not have energy for preservation and/or freezing of food, in addition to avoiding outbreaks of ETAs (Diseases Transmitted by Food)"

However, consumption is split evenly: 50% cut and 50% whole. The fact is that chicken is cut into pieces in some supermarkets and butcher shops, which goes to the detriment of quality control and good preservation of the meat",
            "two": "The reason for this is twofold: on the one hand, some chicken parts can be sold at prices practically at cost, as is the case with &quot;leg and thigh,&quot; and on the other, the commercialization of chicken without freezing avoids the high costs not only of freezing to -18Â°C (IQF: individually quick frozen) but also of transport and storage in the cold chain"
